Welcome to the detailed overview report that represents the ambitious initiative of a furniture design company. This application can potentially revolutionise the furniture buying experience for customers and streamline the design process for in-store designers. This project will focus on improving user experience and enabling smooth collaboration, There are lots of challenges faced by both customers and designers in the traditional furniture buying process of furniture. Customers struggle with how furniture will fit and complement their living spaces. To address these challenges, this proposed desktop application will enable users to see different furniture designs, customise designs based on size and schemas, can choose 2D and 3d views according to user expectations. Moreover, this application will be a useful resource for in-store designers. Giving them the tools gives access to an extensive range of features, such as creating, modifying, and visualising furniture designs in both 2D and 3d formats, Additionally, the application will enable customers to edit and delete designs to ensure flexibility and adaptability during their creative process. Throughout this project, we will examine the functional requirements of the admin side, focusing on capabilities and features that are necessary for designers to make the most effective desktop application.
